    Given F, representing the GP at the points X, produce the mean and
    (co-)variance of the GP at the points Xnew.

    Additionally, there may be Gaussian uncertainty about F as represented by
    q_sqrt. In this case `f` represents the mean of the distribution and
    q_sqrt the square-root of the covariance.

    Additionally, the GP may have been centered (whitened) so that
        p(v) = N( 0, I)
        f = L v
    thus
        p(f) = N(0, LL^T) = N(0, K).
    In this case 'f' represents the values taken by v.

    The method can either return the diagonals of the covariance matrix for
    each output of the full covariance matrix (full_cov).

    We assume K independent GPs, represented by the columns of f (and the
    last dimension of q_sqrt).

    :param q_sqrt: matrix of standard-deviations or Cholesky matrices,
